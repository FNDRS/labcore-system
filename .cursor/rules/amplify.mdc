# Amplify Development Guidelines

When working on Amplify projects, use the AWS MCP Server guided workflows:

- For backend features (auth, data, storage, functions, AI), call `retrieve_agent_sop` with `amplify-backend-implementation`
- For frontend integration, call `retrieve_agent_sop` with `amplify-frontend-integration`
- For deployment tasks, call `retrieve_agent_sop` with `amplify-deployment-guide`---
